**CS144 Project**

A Markdown blogging web application based on Apache Tomcat, MySQL and Java ServerPages (JSP).

The web application allows users to create a new post (written in markdown), preview the post (rendered in HTML), and manage existing posts. 
These tasks are supported through three main webpages: edit page, preview page, and list page.
